# Medieval Poetry Quick Handout

**Purpose:** Give your study group a speedy refresher on medieval poetry genres, key voices, and why they still matter.

## Core Genres & Takeaways
- **Elegy & Heroic:** Honor loss and courage (*The Battle of Maldon* vibes). Link to campus tributes for classmates or mentors.
- **Chivalric:** Knights chase honor and devotion (*Sir Gawain*). Compare with serving family, teachers, or spiritual guides today.
- **Lyric & Ballad:** Short feelings bursts and story songs ("I Have a Young Sister," "Lord Randall," "The Three Ravens"). Think hostel jam sessions or folk storytelling nights.

## Writers on Your Radar
- **Bede:** Monk-historian whose *Ecclesiastical History* shows faith-powered storytelling.
- **Caedmon:** Herdsman-turned-poet; his Hymn praises the Creator with catchy alliteration.
- **John Wycliffe:** Reform-minded scholar who wanted scripture and poetry in everyday English.
- **William Langland:** Dream-vision poet critiquing corruption in *Piers Plowman*.

## Comparative Worldview Notes
- **Values:** Medieval fealty ↔ Pakistani respect for elders; both celebrate service.
- **Faith:** Christian praise hymns ↔ Islamic naat and qawwali devotion.
- **Community:** Ballad circles ↔ WhatsApp voice-note chains keeping stories alive.
- **Gender:** Medieval poems often idealize women; today’s student leaders push for fuller representation.
- **Power:** Langland & Wycliffe challenge authority, much like campus debates and spoken word nights.
